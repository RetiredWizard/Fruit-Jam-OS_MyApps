This is a slightly modified version of Fruit_Jam_Fruitris by relic-se  
(https://github.com/relic-se/Fruit_Jam_Fruitris).  

Changes made to simplify installing on Fruit Jam OS and running without controller hardware  
  
1) Added logic to assign DAC output and volume based on optional launcher.conf.json file  
2) Added logic to skip audio configuration for use on hardware without a LTV320 DAC (not tested yet)  
3) Plan to add logic to bypass button configuration on hardware without buttons (not completed yet)
4) updated the button_handler to support combination button pushes allowing complete game
   play using hardware buttons  
5) Added a keyboard_handler to support the documented keyboard controls in the game

6) Any libraries not currently bundled with Fruit Jam OS that Fruitris required were placed
   in the main Fruitris folder to simplify installing on the Fruit Jam.
