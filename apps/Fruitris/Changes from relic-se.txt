This is a slightly modified version of Fruit_Jam_Fruitris by relic-se  
(https://github.com/relic-se/Fruit_Jam_Fruitris).  

Changes made to simplify installing on Fruit Jam OS and running without controller hardware  
  
1) Added logic to assign DAC output and volume based on optional launcher.conf.json file  
2) Added logic to skip audio configuration for use on hardware without a LTV320 DAC (not tested yet)  
3) updated the button_handler to support combination button pushes allowing complete game
   play using hardware buttons  

4) Any libraries not currently bundled with Fruit Jam OS that Fruitris required were placed
   in the main Fruitris folder to simplify installing on the Fruit Jam.
