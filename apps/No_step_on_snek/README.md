# No Step on Snek

**Sourced from Foamyguy's [Hackaday](https://hackaday.io/project/168815-no-step-on-snek) project**

Modified slightly for Fruit Jam.  

Use Arrow keys to cross the obsticles and reach the Castle Doors on the far side.  

The game features 1 map with 3 kinds of enemies: Boots, Flip Flops, and Converse All Stars. Each of them move at a unique speed and/or direction. There are also 3ish obstacles that blinka cant move on which make the game a bit more challenging by limiting the players lateral movement. They are a news paper bin, a transit ticket kiosk, and a vendor stand with an umbrella topper, which technically counts as a 4th type of obstacle. 

There are 2 types of building graphics to make top and bottom, "foreground" and "background" sections and 2 colors of doors, though only the green one is hooked up at the moment.
